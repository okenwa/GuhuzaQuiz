# 🏆 New Leaderboard Ranking System

## Overview
The leaderboard now ranks players using a **two-tier system** that prioritizes **level progression** first, then **completion speed** as a tie-breaker.

## 🎯 Ranking Criteria

### 1. **Primary: Level Progression** 
- Players are ranked by their current level (`Level_Id`)
- **Higher level = Better rank**
- This encourages players to progress through the game

### 2. **Secondary: Completion Speed**
- For players at the same level, ranking is determined by average completion time
- **Faster completion = Better rank**
- Calculated from completed quiz sessions (`Time_Spent`)

### 3. **Fallback: Points**
- If no completion time data exists, falls back to total points (`Playerpoint`)

## 📊 How It Works

### Database Query
```sql
-- Get all players with their level and completion data
SELECT 
  Player_ID, Player_name, nickname, Playerpoint, Level_Id,
  quizSessions (where Completed = true)
```

### Speed Calculation
1. **Group sessions by level** for each player
2. **Calculate average time per level** 
3. **Overall average completion time** across all levels
4. **Format as minutes and seconds** for display

### Sorting Logic
```javascript
// First priority: Level progression (descending)
if (a.Level_Id !== b.Level_Id) {
  return b.Level_Id - a.Level_Id;
}

// Second priority: Average completion time (ascending - faster is better)
if (a.averageCompletionTime === 0 && b.averageCompletionTime === 0) {
  return b.Playerpoint - a.Playerpoint; // Fallback to points
}

return a.averageCompletionTime - b.averageCompletionTime;
```

## 🎮 UI Updates

### Enhanced Leaderboard Display
- **Level Column**: Shows current level with green badge
- **Speed Column**: Shows average completion time (e.g., "2m 30s")
- **Points Column**: Still displayed but not primary ranking factor

### Stats Section
- **Highest Level**: Shows the highest level achieved by any player
- **Average Speed**: Shows average completion time across all players
- **Total Players**: Number of players in the system

### User Rank Display
- **Your Position**: Current rank in the system
- **Your Level**: Current level progression
- **Your Speed**: Personal average completion time

## 🔄 API Changes

### `/api/leaderboard` (GET)
**New Response Format:**
```json
{
  "Player_ID": 1,
  "Player_name": "Player Name",
  "nickname": "Nickname",
  "Playerpoint": 1500,
  "Level_Id": 3,
  "averageCompletionTime": 150, // seconds
  "completedSessions": 5
}
```

### `/api/leaderboard/rank` (GET)
**Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "rank": 5,
  "level": 3,
  "averageCompletionTime": 150,
  "completedSessions": 5
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Encourages Progression**: Players must advance levels to rank higher
2. **Rewards Skill**: Faster completion times give competitive advantage
3. **Fair Competition**: Players compete within their level tier
4. **Clear Goals**: Easy to understand what improves ranking
5. **Balanced System**: Prevents point farming without progression

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `app/api/leaderboard/route.ts` - Main ranking logic
- `app/api/leaderboard/rank/route.ts` - Individual rank calculation
- `app/hooks/useLeaderboard.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `app/components/EnhancedLeaderboard.tsx` - UI display

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: 30-second cache on API responses
- **Efficient Queries**: Only fetches completed sessions
- **Client-side Processing**: Minimal data transfer

## 🎮 Example Rankings

```
Rank 1: Level 5, 1m 30s avg - "Speed Demon"
Rank 2: Level 5, 2m 15s avg - "Quick Thinker"  
Rank 3: Level 4, 1m 45s avg - "Level Master"
Rank 4: Level 4, 2m 30s avg - "Steady Progress"
Rank 5: Level 3, 1m 20s avg - "Fast Learner"
```

This system creates a more engaging and fair competitive environment where both progression and skill are rewarded! 🏆
